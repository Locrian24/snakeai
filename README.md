# snakeai
Side project for learning machine learning through the game Snake, written in Python 3.7.5, implementing Pygame (1.9.4)
Note: Python 3.7 and Pygame will be needed to run the snake program

To run in terminal:
```
python3 main.py -p <player_model>
```

Base game is controlled by various "players":
  - HumanPlayer (\<human\>):    human controlled
  - RandomPlayer (\<random\>):  randomly moves

  (Not yet implemented: )
  - A* pathfinder
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - DNN (Deep Neural Network)
  - Hamiltonian cycling
  - The SuperPlayer: a combination of all AI players based on Coding Bullet's SnakeFusion (linked at bottom)
