<b>To run in terminal: python3 snakeai.py <player_model> </b>

Base game is controlled by various "players":
  - Human: human controlled

  (Not yet implemented: )
  - A* pathfinder
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - DNN (Deep Neural Network)
  - Hamiltonian cycling
  - The SuperPlayer: a combination of all AI players based on Coding Bullet's SnakeFusion (linked at bottom)
