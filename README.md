# snakeai
Side project for learning machine learning through the game Snake, written in Python 3.7.5, implementing Pygame (1.9.4)

Base game is controlled by various "players":
  - Human: human controlled

  (Not yet implemented: )
  - BFS & DFS pathfinders (seperate)
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - DNN (Deep Neural Network)
  - Hamiltonian cycling
  - The SuperPlayer: a combination of all AI players for maximum performance


<b>To run in terminal: python3 snakeai.py <player_model> </b>
